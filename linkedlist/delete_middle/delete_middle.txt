Given a singly linked list, delete middle  of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5

If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.

If the input linked list is NULL, then it shoudl remain NULL.

If the input linked list has 1 node, then this node should be deleted and new head should be returned.
