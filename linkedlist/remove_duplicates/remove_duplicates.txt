Complete the removeDuplicates() function which takes a list sorted in non-decreasing order 
and deletes any duplicate nodes from the list. The list should only be traversed once.

For example if the linked list is 11->11->11->21->43->43->60 
then removeDuplicates() should convert the list to 11->21->43->60
