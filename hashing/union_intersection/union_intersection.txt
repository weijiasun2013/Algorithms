Union and Intersection of two Linked Lists
Given two Linked Lists, create union and intersection lists that contain union and intersection of the elements present in the given lists. Order of elments in output lists doesn¡¯t matter.
Example:
Input:
   List1: 10->15->4->20
   lsit2:  8->4->2->10
Output:
   Intersection List: 4->10
   Union List: 2->8->20->4->15->10
Method (Use Hashing)
Union (list1, list2)
Initialize the result list as NULL and create an empty hash table. Traverse both lists one by one, for each element being visited, look the element in hash table. If the element is not present, then insert the element to result list. If the element is present, then ignore it.
Intersection (list1, list2)
Initialize the result list as NULL and create an empty hash table. Traverse list1. For each element being visited in list1, insert the element in hash table. Traverse list2, for each element being visited in list2, look the element in hash table. If the element is present, then insert the element to result list. If the element is not present, then ignore it.
