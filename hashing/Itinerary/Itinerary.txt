Find Itinerary from a given list of tickets
Given a list of tickets, find itinerary in order using the given list.
Example:
Input:
"Chennai" -> "Banglore"
"Bombay" -> "Delhi"
"Goa"    -> "Chennai"
"Delhi"  -> "Goa"

Output: 
Bombay->Delhi, Delhi->Goa, Goa->Chennai, Chennai->Banglore,
It may be assumed that the input list of tickets is not cyclic and there is one ticket from every city except final destination.
One Solution is to build a graph and do Topological Sorting of the graph. Time complexity of this solution is O(n).
We can also use hashing to avoid building a graph. The idea is to first find the starting point. A starting point would never be on ¡®to¡¯ side of a ticket. Once we find the starting point, we can simply traverse the given map to print itinerary in order. Following are steps.
