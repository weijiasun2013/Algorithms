Check if an array can be divided into pairs whose sum is divisible by k
Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {9, 7, 5, 3}, 
           k = 6
Output: True
We can divide array into (9, 3) and
(7, 5). Sum of both of these pairs 
is a multiple of 6.

Input: arr[] = {92, 75, 65, 48, 45, 35}, 
           k = 10
Output: True
We can divide array into (92, 48), (75, 65) 
and (45, 35). Sum of all these pairs is a
multiple of 10.

Input: arr[] = {91, 74, 66, 48}, k = 10
Output: False
Below implementation uses map in C++ STL. The map is typically implemented using Red-Black Tree and takes O(Log n) time for access. Therefore time complexity of below implementation is O(n Log n), but the algorithm can be easily implemented in O(n) time using hash table.
