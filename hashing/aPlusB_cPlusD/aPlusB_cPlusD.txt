Find four elements a, b, c and d in an array such that a+b = c+d
Given an array of distinct integers, find if there are two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a+b = c+d, and a, b, c and d are distinct elements. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.
Example:
Input:   {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8}
Output:  (3, 8) and (4, 7)
Explanation: 3+8 = 4+7

Input:   {3, 4, 7, 1, 12, 9};
Output:  (4, 12) and (7, 9)
Explanation: 4+12 = 7+9

Input:  {65, 30, 7, 90, 1, 9, 8};
Output:  No pairs found
An Efficient Solution can solve this problem in O(n2) time. The idea is to use hashing. We use sum as key and pair as value in hash table.
Loop i = 0 to n-1 :
    Loop j = i + 1 to n-1 :
        calculate sum
        If in hash table any index already exist
            Then print (i, j) and previous pair 
            from hash table  
        Else update hash table
    EndLoop;
EndLoop;
