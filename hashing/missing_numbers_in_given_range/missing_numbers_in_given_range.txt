Find missing elements of a range
Given an array arr[0..n-1] of distinct elements and a range [low, high], find all numbers that are in range, but not in array. The missing elements should be printed in sorted order.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {10, 12, 11, 15}, 
       low = 10, hight = 15
Output: 13, 14

Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 11, 51, 15}, 
       low = 50, hight = 55
Output: 50, 52, 53, 54

Tim complexity is O(n + (high-low+1))
Create a dictionary to store all elements in the array
Give a loop to check each of the range and print out
