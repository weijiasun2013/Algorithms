Print all subarrays with 0 sum
Given an array, print all subarrays in the array which has sum 0.
Examples:
Input:  arr = [6, 3, -1, -3, 4, -2, 2,
             4, 6, -12, -7]
Output:  
Subarray found from Index 2 to 4
Subarray found from Index 2 to 6          
Subarray found from Index 5 to 6
Subarray found from Index 6 to 9
Subarray found from Index 0 to 10
A better approach is to use Hashing.
Do following for each element in the array
1.	Maintain sum of elements encountered so far in a variable (say sum).
2.	If current sum is 0, we found a subarray starting from index 0 and ending at index current index
3.	Check if current sum exists in the hash table or not.
4.	If current sum exists in the hash table, that means we have subarray(s) present with 0 sum that ends at current index.
5.	Insert current sum into the hash table
